# SwiftModern

Learning modern Swift development by building real projects. Focusing on Swift concurrency (async/await, actors, tasks) and SwiftUI because that's where iOS development is headed.
This is my playground for understanding how concurrency actually works in Swift and getting comfortable with SwiftUI's declarative approach. Lots of experiments, some mistakes, and hopefully some useful examples along the way.
What I'm working on:

Getting async/await to click in my brain
Building UIs with SwiftUI instead of fighting with storyboards
Understanding actors and why they matter
Making apps that don't freeze or crash from threading issues

Just a collection of projects and code as I figure out modern Swift. If you're learning this stuff too, maybe you'll find something useful here.
